# Support

The Government Digital Service (GDS) maintains the service behind data.gov.uk and helps publishers to manage and update their data.

For questions about a dataset, you can contact the publisher directly if theyâ€™ve provided contact details on the dataset page.

To report a problem with data.gov.uk, raise a data request or for other queries, [contact us](https://data.gov.uk/support).

We provide operational support from 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday.
