# Get and manage accounts

There are two levels of access on data.gov.uk: editor and administrator (admin).

Editors are able to publish and manage datasets associated with their organisation (for example, a local authority or central government department). Editors and admins can be in multiple organisations.

Admins have the same abilities as editors but can also:

* add and remove editors
* manage editors’ activity
* update information about their organisation(s)

## Get an account

### Get invited by an admin

To get an account, you should ask an existing admin to invite you. This is the fastest and most reliable way to gain access. The admin can follow these [instructions for adding/removing accounts](#add-or-remove-editors-and-admins).

### Register for an account

If there are no admins, or you do not know who the admins for your organisation are, you can [register for an account](https://data.gov.uk/support). This process is slower as it requires a GOV.UK developer to manually process your request.

When completing the form, state whether you need editor or admin permissions.

## Add or remove editors and admins

An organisation can have multiple editors and admins.

As an admin, you can add additional editors or admins to an organisation via the [Data Publisher](https://ckan.publishing.service.gov.uk/).

1. Go to the **Publishers** tab.
1. Go to the name of the organisation, then **Manage** > **Members** > **Add member**.
1. Add the email address of the user you want to add.
1. Choose whether you want the user to be an editor or an admin.
1. Select **Add Member** and add the user’s government email address.
1. Select **Add**.

The recipient will receive email instructions on setting up an account.

To remove a user, follow steps 1 and 2. Then select the button with the cross next to their name to remove their permissions.

## Create or edit an organisation

To create a new organisation, [contact the data.gov.uk team](https://data.gov.uk/support).  

Only admins can edit information about an existing organisation.

To edit organisation details you must have an admin account and sign into that account.

1. Select **Publishers**.
1. Select the organisation you want to edit.
1. Select **About**.
1. Select **Manage**.
1. Amend the information you want to change.
1. Select **Update Publisher**.
